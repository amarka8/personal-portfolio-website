                    Welcome to my Personal Site and thanks for visiting! I am an undergraduate at Rice University interested 
                    in applying Machine Learning Algorithms to real world problems. In the past, 
                    I analyzed mortgage denial rates using Python Data Science Libraries under Dr. Padmanabhan Seshaiyer at George Mason University. 
                    I am currently working with Dr. Lulu Shang at the MD Anderson Cancer Center as a Biostatistics Researcher. You can check out my projects on my GitHub and LinkedIn!

                <p>
                    I am fascinated by the effects of algorithmic bias on those seeking out loans for things 
                    like homebuying and car purchasing. As of late, I have been exploring spatial 
                    transcriptomic and scRNAseq data and their potential to help plan cancer treatment.
