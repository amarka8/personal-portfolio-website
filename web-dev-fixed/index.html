      Welcome to my Personal Site and thanks for visiting! I am an undergraduate at Rice University interested 
      in applying Machine Learning Algorithms to real world problems. In the past, 
      I analyzed mortage denial rates using Python Data Science Libraries under Dr. Padmanabhan Seshaiyer at George Mason University. 
      I am currently working with Dr. Lulu Shang at the MD Anderson Cancer Center as a Biostatistics Researcher.

      I am fascinated by the effects of algorithmic bias on those seeking out loans for things 
      like homebuying and car purchasing. As of late, I have been exploring spatial 
      transcriptomic and scRNAseq data and their potential to help plan cancer treatment.
